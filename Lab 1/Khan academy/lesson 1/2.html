    <h1>If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster and treat those two impostors just the same</h1>
    

    <p> If you can keep your head when all about you <br>
        <em>Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;</em> <br>
        <em>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,</em> <br>
        But make allowance for their doubting too: <br> 
        <strong> If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,</strong> <br>
        Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies, <br>
        <strong>Or being hated don't give way to hating,</strong> <br>
        And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;
    </p>
